# Instalation

You need to have Ruby installed. If you don't you can install it using [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install).

You need to install [Gosu](http://www.libgosu.org/). You can instal it with [rubygem](http://rubygems.org/) by typing `gem install gosu`.

# Running

```
cd game
./game.rb
```

There is a nicer old version that you can try:

```
git checkout -b old-version 8839543ad4a867315e1c56212c5094c9102bb59f
./test/try2/main.rb                                                                                                                                  
```
